- en: Today, we live in an increasingly data-centric and data-driven world. We live
    in a world where companies like Amazon track every item we view and every item
    we purchase so as to recommend similar products to us. We live in a world where
    companies like Google store every search query thrown at them so as to recommend
    better search queries in the future. We live in a world where social media sites
    like Facebook remember every event and every thought we share with our friends
    so as to better learn about each of their hundreds of millions of users. We live
    in an increasingly data-centric world, and so it's imperative that we develop
    applications with a data-centric perspective.

- en: Take a look around you — the growth of mobile devices, such as smart phones
    and tablets, has been explosive over the last couple of years. This book is meant
    to be an exploration of data and Android with a quick dive into the various methods
    the folks over at Google have built into the Android OS. This book not only strives
    to show you all the different data storage methods available, but also strives
    to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of each method. By the end of this
    book, my goal is for you to be able to craft an efficient, well-designed, and
    scalable data-centric application.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Storing Data on Android"), *Storing Data
    on Android*, focuses on all the different local data storage methods available
    on Android. It provides ample code examples of each storage method, as well as
    a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Using a SQLite Database"), *Using a SQLite
    Database*, takes a deeper dive into the most complex and most commonly used form
    of local data storage — the SQLite database — by walking you through the implementation
    of a custom SQLite database.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. SQLite Queries"), *SQLite Queries*, is designed
    to be a cursory overview of the SQL query language. It teaches the reader how
    to construct powerful database queries, which can then be used with any SQLite
    database.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Using Content Providers"), *Using Content
    Providers*, expands upon the previous SQLite database chapters by showing the
    reader how to expose his/her database to the entire Android OS through the use
    of content providers. It walks the reader through a full implementation of a content
    provider, and finishes with a brief discussion on benefits of making your data
    public.'

    the Contacts Table*, is devoted to exploring the most widely used content provider
    provided by the Android OS — the Contacts content provider. It explores the structure
    of the Contacts tables, and provides examples of common queries.'

    talks about ways the user can bind their data to the user interface. Because of
    how data is typically displayed as lists, this chapter walks through the implementations
    of two types of list adapters.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Android Databases in Practice"), *Android
    Databases in Practice*, tries to step away from the programming and focus on higher-level
    design concepts. It talks about ways in which all the local storage methods discussed
    up to this point can be used, and also highlights the downfalls of such local
    methods — opening the door for the next couple of chapters, where we focus on
    external data stores.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Exploring External Databases"), *Exploring
    External Databases*, introduces the notion of using an external database and lists
    some common external data stores that are available to the reader. The chapter
    finishes with an example of how to set up a Google App Engine data store.'

    and Storing Data*, extends the development of the previous chapter by talking
    about ways in which your application can go and collect data, which can then be
    inserted into your new external database. The methods for collecting data include
    using available APIs, as well as writing custom web scrapers.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Bringing it Together"), *Bringing it Together*,
    finishes the application we started in the previous two chapters by showing the
    reader how to first create HTTP servlets, and second make HTTP requests from the
    mobile application to these HTTP servlets. This chapter serves as the culmination
    of the book, and shows the reader how to connect their mobile application with
    their external database, and ultimately parse and display the HTTP response as
    a list.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book targets developers who have some experience with databases and other
    backend design concepts, but who may want to see these concepts applied to mobile
    applications. Developers who are experienced with mobile applications and/or the
    Android platform, but who may not be as familiar with backend systems and designing/implementing
    database schemas, will also find this book useful.
