    need to compile the class again so that FitNesse can use the new code. One way
    to do this is just to run your Java tests from the IDE, forcing a recompile.

    the concepts serving as the foundations, explored the Given-When-Then vocabulary
    idea, and introduced FitNesse and Slim as helpful tools in deploying tests.

    we are still limited to test subjects that are testable under the JVM, avoiding
    the use of Android-specific classes and the user interface. We will be exploring
    some alternatives to overcome this limitation in [Chapter 9](part0079_split_000.html#page
    "Chapter 9. Alternative Testing Tactics"), *Alternative Testing Tactics*.

    application behaving correctly, and according to our test specifications.
