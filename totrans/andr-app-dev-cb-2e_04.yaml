    to do it in code. This is especially true if you wanted a menu item to be visible
    (or enabled) based on some external criteria. Menus can also be included in resource
    folders, but there are times when you need code to perform the logic. One example

    have defined our own menu IDs and passed them to the `add()` method.

    an external event, we created a button to toggle a Boolean flag. The visibility
    of the **Download** menu is determined by the flag. This is where you would want
    to create your custom code based on whatever criteria you set. Your flag could
    be set using the current player level or maybe when a new level is ready for release;
    you send a Push message, which enables the menu item.

    We will go a step further by starting Contextual Mode when the item is checked
    using the `onItemClick()` event. If we don't do this, the only way to initiate
    the Contextual Mode would be with a long click, which may leave many users unaware
    of the additional functionality.

    to include an Action Bar to use a Contextual Action Bar. If you do have an Action
    Bar and it's visible, it will be overlaid with the CAB. If you do not have an
    Action Bar as the default with this recipe, the layout will be redrawn to include
    the CAB (and redrawn again when the CAB is dismissed). If you want the Action
    Bar to be visible, either change the theme for the Activity or change the base
    class and set up the `ListView` manually.
