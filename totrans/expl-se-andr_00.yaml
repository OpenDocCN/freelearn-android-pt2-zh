- en: This book introduces the Security Enhancements (SE) for Android open source
    project and walks you through the process of securing new embedded systems with
    SE for Android. To our knowledge, this book is the first source to document such
    a process in its entirety so that students, DIY hobbyists, and engineers can create
    custom systems secured by SE for Android. Generally, only original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) do this, and quite commonly, the target device is a phone or tablet. We
    truly hope our book will change that, engaging a wide audience in development
    so they can use and understand these modern security tools.

- en: We worked very hard to ensure this text is not just a step-by-step technology
    book. Specifically, we've chosen a model that directs you to fail your way to
    success. You will first gain appropriate theoretical understanding of how security
    is gained and enforced. Then we will introduce a system that has never been secured
    that way (not even by us, prior to writing this book). Next, we'll guide you through
    all our intelligent guesswork, embracing unexpected failures for the newly found
    idiosyncrasies they expose, and eventually enforcing our custom security policies.
    It requires you to learn to resolve differences between major open source projects
    such as SELinux, SE for Android, and Google Android, each of which has independent
    goals and deployment schedules. This prepares you to secure other devices, the
    process for which is always different, but hopefully, will now be more accessible.
