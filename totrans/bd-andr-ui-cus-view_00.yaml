- en: Many years ago, before the launch of Android and the iPhone, one of the major
    concerns was having a central place to purchase and download mobile applications.
    Nowadays, we manage to solve this issue with widely available centralized application
    stores such as Google Play, at the expense of application discoverability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google Play, like any other mobile application store, is highly saturated. Unless
    an application does something unique or has something special, it's extremely
    hard to stand out from the dozens of applications doing approximately the same,
    or even if they’re completely unrelated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Increasing marketing spending might temporarily alleviate the issue but, in
    the long term, applications still need to figure out that unique functionality
    or that detail that makes them different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to make a distinctive application is to slightly diverge from the Android
    standard widgets and UI components and include a specific custom view custom menu,
    or, at the end of the day, anything that makes it exceptional. We should be aware
    that this doesn't mean we should completely ignore the Android standard widgets
    and rewrite the whole UI of the application. As with almost everything, do user
    tests and discover what works and what doesn’t work for them. Explore new options
    and solve the pains they have, but don't overdo it. Sometimes, creating a particular
    menu on top of your application might solve navigation problems, or a well-defined
    animation might communicate the right transition for the application's users.

- en: In this book, we will see how to start building custom views for Android and
    integrate them into our applications. We’ll see in detail how to interact with
    them and add animations and comprehensive examples, both using 2D and 3D rendering
    capabilities. Finally, we will also see how to share our custom views so they
    can be reused in our enterprise environment, and also how to open source them
    and make them available to the Android development community.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to follow the examples in this book, you’ll need Android Studio installed.
    We’ll briefly cover how to install and set up a device emulator in the first chapter.
    It’s highly recommended to get at least Android Studio 3.0\. At the time of writing
    this book, Android Studio 3.0 is still beta, but stable enough to develop, run,
    and test all the examples. In addition, our recommendation is to have an Android
    device to better experience user interactions in the custom views we’ll create,
    but they will also work in an Android emulator.
