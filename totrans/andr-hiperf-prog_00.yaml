- en: Performant applications are one of the key drivers of success in the mobile
    world. Users may abandon an app if it runs slowly. Learning how to build applications
    that balance speed and performance with functionality and UX can be a challenge;
    however, it's now more important than ever to get that balance right.

- en: '*Android High Performance Programming* will make you think about how to wring
    the most from any hardware your app is installed on, so you can increase your
    reach and engagement. The book begins by providing an introduction to state-of-the-art
    Android techniques and the importance of performance in an Android application.
    Then, we will explain the Android SDK tools regularly used to debug and profile
    Android applications. We will also learn about some advanced topics such as building
    layouts, multithreading, networking, and security. Battery life is one of the
    biggest bottlenecks in applications; this book will show typical examples of code
    that exhausts battery life, how to prevent this, and how to measure battery consumption
    from an application in every kind of situation.'
