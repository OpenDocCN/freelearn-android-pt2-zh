- en: Android is an emerging technology with lots of apps on the Google Play market.
    Till date, it is the biggest marvel in smartphone technology, propelling a larger
    number of developers toward Android development. Intent is an essential part of
    any Android application, and no Android application is complete without using
    them. Features such as listening for broadcasts, sending messages, sharing via
    social networks, sending notifications, and accessing hardware components such
    as camera, sensors, and Wi-Fi, can be easily be carried out in your Android applications
    using intents.

- en: '*Learning Android Intents* focuses on using intents to make the best use of
    various features of Android platforms. It is ideal for developers who want to
    understand the backbone and the domain of Android intents, its power, and the
    need of it inside an Android application. Practical, in-depth examples are used
    throughout the book to help understand the key concepts of using intents.'

- en: The book starts by introducing the very basic concepts of Android and its various
    facts and figures, such as the different Android versions, their release dates,
    and evolution of Android devices. While covering the basic technical concepts,
    it proceeds from the easiest route of introducing Android intents toward the more
    practical view of Android intents in terms of components and features.

- en: In this book, you will learn how to use different components and features such
    as transferring data between activities, invoke various features and components
    of Android, execute different built-in and custom-made services, access the hardware
    and software components of an Android device, and send notifications and alarms.
    You will gain theoretical knowledge of what is running behind the concepts of
    Android intents and practical knowledge of the mobile-efficient ways to perform
    a certain task using Android intents.

    to Android Intents*, covers the introduction of intents, basic key concepts of
    intent, the role of intents in Android applications, a technical overview of intents,
    use of objects in the `android.content.Intent` class, and its structure. Further,
    this chapter also explains two practical examples of how to use intents to navigate
    from one activity to another.'

    and Its Categorization*, covers more details about intents and expands on their
    categories such as explicit intents and implicit intents. This chapter also provides
    practical implementation examples of using intents, such as sharing data with
    other apps, getting shared data from other Android apps, picking images from a
    gallery, and starting an activity or services through intents.'

    for Mobile Components*, covers the basic knowledge about most common hardware
    components found in every Android device such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, Global
    Positioning System (GPS), geomagnetic fields, and motion and position sensors.
    After that, this chapter provides details on the role of intents with these hardware
    components along with practical examples for using intents, including turning
    Bluetooth on/off, making a device discoverable, turning the Wi-Fi on/off, opening
    Wi-Fi settings, taking pictures, recording videos, and carrying out speech recognition
    and text-to-speech conversion.'

    Using Intents*, covers the in-depth details of data transfer using intents. This
    chapter discusses transferring data between activities through different methods,
    simple data transfer using the `putExtra()` method of the `Intent` class, sending
    custom data objects by the `Parcelable` and `Serializeable` class objects, and
    some scenarios of data transfer in the Android system.'

    *Accessing Android Features Using Intents*, covers the most common software features
    such as layouts, display, connectivity, communication, accessibility, touch, and
    hardware support found in the Android OS. The chapter contains a discussion on
    two important `AndroidManifest` tags, `<uses-feature>` and `<uses-permission>`,
    their use, and comparison of mobile hardware components with Android OS features
    relating to these tags. This chapter provides practical example implementations
    of using intents in Android applications such as making calls, sending SMS/MMS
    messages, confirming message delivery, receiving messages, and sending notifications
    with custom layouts.'
