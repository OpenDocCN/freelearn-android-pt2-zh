    2D graphics library. That would be our most common approach, but sometimes, we
    might need some more horsepower because of additional render particularities or
    the requirements of our custom view. In those cases, we might use **OpenGL for
    Embedded Systems** (**OpenGL ES**) and enable 3D rendering operations in our view.

    is a very popular cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.

    geometry, it is probably handier to model it on a 3D modeling tool rather than
    doing it by code. We can cover multiple chapters on this topic, but let's just
    look at a quick example of how can it be done and you can extend it to your needs.

- en: In this chapter, we've seen how to create very basic custom views using OpenGL
    ES. OpenGL ES adds a lot of possibilities when creating custom views, but it also
    adds a lot of complexity if we don't have that much experience working with it.
    We could cover many more chapters on this topic, but that is not the main goal
    of this book. We'll have some more examples of using 3D custom views, but there
    is a lot of published material on how to learn, or even master, OpenGL ES on Android
    devices.

    to our custom view. As we could animate any parameter or variable, it will not
    matter if it is a 3D custom view or a standard 2D custom view, but we'll see how
    to apply animations in both cases.
