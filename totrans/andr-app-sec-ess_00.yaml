- en: In today's techno-savvy world, more and more of our lives are going digital
    and all this information is accessible anytime and anywhere using mobile devices.
    There are thousands of apps available for users to download and play with. With
    so much information easily accessible using application on the mobile devices,
    the biggest challenge is to secure the users' private information and respect
    their privacy.

- en: The first Android phone came out in 2009\. The mobile ecosystem has not been
    the same since then. The openness of the platform and a far less restrictive application
    model created excitement in the developer community and also fostered innovation
    and experimentation. But just as every coin has two sides, so does openness. The
    Android platform irked the imagination of the so-called bad guys. Android provides
    a perfect test bed for them to try out their ideas. It is thus of great importance
    not only as a developer, but also as a consumer, to be aware of Android's security
    model and how to use it judiciously to protect yourself and your consumers.

    components with permissions, defining security in manifest file, cryptographic
    algorithms, and protocols on Android stack, secure storage, security focused testing,
    and protecting enterprise data on device is also discussed in detail. You will
    also learn how to be security aware when integrating newer technologies and use
    cases such as NFC and mobile payments into your Android applications.

    the latest release. I have tested all my code snippets on this platform. Ever
    since the first release of Cupcake in 2009, Google has been continuously enhancing
    the security of Android with successive releases. For example, remote wipe and
    device management APIs were added in Android 2.2 (API level 8) to make Android
    more appealing to the business community. Whenever relevant, I have referenced
    the release that started supporting a particular feature.
