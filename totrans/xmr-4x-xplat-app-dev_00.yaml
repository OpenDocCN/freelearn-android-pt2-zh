    in C#: Xamarin Studio, an addin for Visual Studio, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.
    Xamarin gives you direct access to the native APIs on each platform and the flexibility
    of sharing C# code.  Using Xamarin and C#, you get better productivity when compared
    to Java or Objective-C, and still retain great performance compared to an HTML
    or JavaScript solution.'

- en: In this book, we will develop a real-world sample application to demonstrate
    what you can do with Xamarin technologies, and build on core platform concepts
    for iOS and Android. We will also cover advanced topics such as push notifications,
    retrieving contacts, using the camera, and GPS location. With Xamarin 3, a new
    framework was introduced called Xamarin.Forms. We will cover the basics of Xamarin.Forms
    and how you can apply it to cross-platform development. Finally, we will walkthrough
    what it takes to submit your application to the Apple App Store and Google Play.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this book you will need a Mac computer running at least OS X 10.10\. Apple
    requires iOS applications to be compiled on a Mac, so Xamarin has the same requirement.
    You can either use Xamarin Studio (best for Mac) or Visual Studio (best for Windows)
    as an IDE. Developers on Windows can work on iOS applications in Visual Studio
    by connecting to a Mac on their local network. Visit [https://xamarin.com/download](https://xamarin.com/download)
    or [https://visualstudio.com/download](https://visualstudio.com/download) to download
    the appropriate software.
