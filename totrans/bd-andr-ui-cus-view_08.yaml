    We've seen how to interact with them, how to draw 2D and 3D primitives, and we
    want somebody else to be able to use it. That is a great idea! It might be for
    ourselves, we might reuse it in a future project, or it might be a project by
    one of our colleagues. If we aim higher, it might be a project by the Android
    community.

    lots of open source libraries. All these contributions by developers have helped
    many other developers get started in Android development, learn to get a deeper
    understanding of some concepts, or be able to build their applications in the
    first place.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should always aim for the highest quality possible, even though we're building
    a custom view or component only for ourselves or for a small application. However,
    there are some additional checks and best practices that we've to take into account
    if we want to share our custom view so others can use it. If that is our goal,
    and we'd like to get as many developers as possible using it in their applications
    or contributing to it, it'll be quite challenging to involve them if we ignore
    these basic recommendations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Considerations and recommendations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something we should consider is that once we share our custom view, it might
    be used for many Android applications. If our custom view has errors and crashes,
    it'll crash the application using it. The application's users will not consider
    the custom view at fault but rather the application itself. The application developer,
    or developers, might try to open an issue or even submit a pull request to fix
    it, but if the custom view gives them too much trouble, they'll just replace it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This applies to your own applications as well; you don't want to use an unstable
    component or custom view as you might end up either rewriting it or patching it
    up. As we've just mentioned, we should always aim for the highest quality. If
    our custom view is only used in one single application, the impact of finding
    a critical issue once it's at the production stage or the application is published
    to the store or stores only affects one application. However, if it's used by
    several applications, the impact and cost of maintenance increases. You can imagine
    the impact of detecting a highly critical issue of an open source component and
    having to make new releases of all the applications using it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, you should try to keep your code clean, well-organized, properly
    tested, and reasonably documented. It'll be easier for you, as well as your colleagues
    if you're sharing the custom view at your company, to maintain the custom view,
    and if it's open source, it will encourage contributions and won't actually scare
    external contributors. As with many other things, common sense applies. Don't
    over-document your custom view as basically nobody will read it; keep it as simple
    as possible and straight to the point.

    *Implementing Your First Custom View*, how to parameterize a custom view. We've
    created it because it might serve a very specific purpose, but in general the
    more configurable it is, the more likely it will be used somewhere else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine we're building a progress bar. If our custom view always draws a horizontal
    red bar, it'll have its uses but not many as it's too specific. If we allow the
    developer of the application using this custom view to customize the color of
    the bar, we'd add several other use cases for it. If, in addition, we also allow
    developers to configure the background color or what kind of primitive we're drawing
    instead of a horizontal bar, we'll cover even more different scenarios with our
    custom view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to be careful as well; adding so many options will also increase the
    complexity of the code and the component itself. Configuring colors is straightforward
    and doesn't have that much impact, but being able to change the drawing primitive,
    for example, might be slightly trickier. Adding complexity might impact on performance,
    stability, and our ability to test and verify all scenarios are working fine when
    publishing it or making a new release.

    the latter cannot be run by itself on a device or emulator and will only produce
    an `.aar` file. This `.aar` file can, later on, be added as a dependency in an
    Android application project or other libraries. We could also have sub-modules

    It is highly recommended to use semantic versioning, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, when
    versioning our custom view. This way we can easily indicate if changes in one
    version are introducing incompatibilities or not. For instance, using semantic
    versioning, if we change the major number, we're indicating we've introduced incompatibilities
    with previous versions, or by changing the minor number, we indicate we've added
    new functionality without introducing any incompatibility. This is important for
