- en: Since its first release in 2008, Android has become the largest mobile platform
    in the world. The total number of apps in Google Play is expected to reach 1,000,000
    in mid 2013\. Most of the Android apps are written in Java with Android Software
    Development Kit (SDK). Many developers only write Android code in Java even though
    they are experienced with C/C++, without realizing what a powerful tool they are
    giving up.

- en: Android **Native Development Kit** (**NDK**) was released in 2009 to help developers
    write and port native code. It offers a set of cross-compiling tools and a few
    libraries. Programming in NDK offers two main advantages. Firstly, you can optimize
    your apps in native code and boost performance. Secondly, you can reuse a large
    number of existing C/C++ code. *Android Native Development Kit* is a practical
    guide to help you write Android native code with NDK. We will start with the basics
    such as **Java Native Interface** (**JNI**), and build and debug a native app
    (chapter 1 to 3). We will then explore various libraries provided by NDK, including
    OpenGL ES, Native Application API, OpenSL ES, OpenMAX AL, and so on (Chapters
    4 to 7). After that, we will discuss porting existing applications and libraries
    to Android with NDK (Chapters 8 and 9). Finally, we will demonstrate how to write
    multimedia apps and games with NDK (Bonus chapters 1 and 2).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A computer with Windows, Ubuntu Linux, or MacOS installed is necessary (Linux
    or MacOS is preferable). Although we can run Android apps with an emulator, it
    is slow and inefficient for Android development. Therefore, it is recommended
    to have an Android device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book assumes a basic understanding of C and C++ programming languages. You
    should also be familiar with Java and Android SDK.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the sample code of this book is based on Android ndk r8 unless otherwise
    stated, since it is the latest version of NDK at the time of writing. By the time
    the book is published, there should be newer versions. The code should also run
    on any newer versions. Therefore we can install NDK r8 or later.

- en: The book is written for anyone who is interested in writing native code for
    Android. The chapters are arranged from basic to intermediate to advanced, and
    they are relatively independent. Readers who are new to NDK are recommended to
    read from the beginning to the end, while readers who are familiar with NDK can
    pick up any specific chapters or even specific recipes.
