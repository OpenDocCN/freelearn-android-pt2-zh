    speak and listen. Begin by developing small personal applications that you can
    show your friends and relatives. You can also show the applications to prospective
    employers or clients. Some small personal applications that my students have implemented
    are below. Build one of these applications to demonstrate what you can do with
    speech technologies on Android mobile devices.

- en: Deliver your message not only via text, but also voice (a recorded voice sounds
    more personalized than synthesized voice). Collect responses from the person receiving
    the greeting card and e-mail them to yourself.

- en: Present recipe ingredients and instructions for preparing a dish verbally, as
    well as visually, to assist preparation. The cook verbally navigates through the
    instructions. One student replaced synthesized instructions with verbal instructions
    recorded by her grandmother. So the instructions for baking grandma's apple pie
    are presented in grandma's actual voice. Sweet!

- en: Record snippets of a fairy tale in your own voice. Insert voice menus between
    snippets that ask the listener to choose the next snippet. Your children can listen
    to you telling them bedtime stories, and direct the actions taken by the story
    characters.

    for learning times tables, names of important people, dates in history, and words
    in a foreign language.

    for specific members of your household.

    graphics, and landmark descriptions that the users can see. Use the GPS API to
    locate the mobile phone and read/display information about its current location.
    Or virtually explore places where you cannot go. One student developed a travel
    guide of the universe using photos from NASA.

    with speech technologies. If you are a student, submit your speech application
    to the **Applied Voice Input/Output Society** (**AVIOS**) student contest [http://www.avios.org/](http://www.avios.org/).
    Submit your speech application to the Google Store, [https://play.google.com/store](https://play.google.com/store).
