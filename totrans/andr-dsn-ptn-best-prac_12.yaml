    an app that could have its circulation boosted by generating Facebook likes and

    embed any web content we like right into an activity with the **WebView** class.
    This extension of the view class can be used to add a single web page to an app
    or even build a complete web application. The WebView class is extremely useful
    when we have products or data that need regular updating, as this can be achieved
    without having to recode and release updates.
