- en: Welcome to *Android Design Patterns and Best Practice*, a comprehensive guide
    to how to get the most out of your apps with the tried and tested programming
    philosophy, design patterns. These patterns provide a logical and elegant approach
    to solving many of the development problems that coders face. These patterns act
    as a guide creating a clear path from problem to solution, and although applying
    a design pattern does not guarantee best practice in itself, it will hugely assist
    the process and make the discovery of design flaws far easier. Design patterns
    can be implemented on very many platforms and written in as many programming languages.
    Some code libraries even apply patterns as part of their internal mechanics, and
    many readers will already be familiar with the Java Observer and Observable classes.
    The Android SDK we will be exploring makes great use of many patterns, such as
    factories, builders and listeners (which are really just observer patterns). Although
    we will cover these built-in design patterns, the book will mostly explore how
    we can build our own, custom made, patterns and apply them to Android development.
    Rather than approach each design pattern in turn, this book approaches the subject
    from the perspective of a developer, moving through each aspect of app development
    exploring individual design patterns as they would arise in the course of building
    an Android app. To clarify this journey, we will be focusing on a single imaginary
    app, designed to support a small business. This will take us from application
    conception through to publication, covering such topics as UI design, internal
    logic and user interaction along the way. During each of these steps we will explore
    those design patterns that are relevant to that process, by first exploring the
    pattern in its abstract form and then applying it to that particular situation.
    By the end of the book you will have learned how design patterns can be applied
    to all aspects of Android development and how using them assists best practice.
    It is the concept of design patterns that is more important than any specific
    pattern itself. Patterns can, and should, be adapted to suit our specific purposes,
    and by learning this way of approaching app development, we can even go on to
    create entirely original patterns of our own.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Design Patterns"), *Design Patterns*, introduces
    the development environment, and two common design patterns, the factory and abstract
    factory.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Creational Patterns"), *Creational Patterns*,
    covers material and interface design, exploring the design support library and
    the builder design pattern.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Material Patterns"), *Material Patterns*,
    introduces Android User Interfaces and some of the most significant material design
    components such as the app bar and sliding navigation drawer. This will introduce
    menus and action icons and how to implement them and how to use a drawer listener
    to detect user activity.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Layout Patterns"), *Layout Patterns*, leads
    in from the previous one, delving further into Android Layout design patterns
    and how gravity and weight can be used to create layouts that work on a variety
    of devices. This will take us onto how Android handles device orientation and
    screen size and shape differences. The strategy pattern is introduced and demonstrated.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Structural Patterns"), *Structural Patterns*,
    delves us deeper into the design library and create a layout governed by a coordinator
    layout with a recycler view. This requires exploring the adapter design pattern,
    first the internal versions and then we build one of our own, as well as a bridge
    pattern and facade and filter patterns.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Activating Patterns"), *Activating Patterns*,
    shows us how to apply patterns directly to our app. We cover more design library
    features such as collapsing toolbars, scrolling and divider. We crate a custom
    dialog, triggered by user activity. We revisit the factory patterns and show how
    a builder pattern can be used to inflate a UI.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Combining Patterns"), *Combining Patterns*,
    introduces and demonstrates two new structural patterns the prototype and decorator,
    covering their flexibility. This is then put in to practice as we use the patterns
    to control a UI comprised of different compound buttons such as switches and radio
    groups.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Composing Patterns"), *Composing Patterns*,
    concentrates on the composite pattern and how it can be used in many situations
    and how to select the right situation. We then continue to use it in a practical
    demonstration to inflate a nested UI. This leads into the storage and retrieval
    of persistent data, using internal storage, application files and ultimately user
    settings in the form of shared preferences.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Observing Patterns"), *Observing Patterns*,
    looks at the visual processes involved in the transitions from one Activity to
    another and how this can be far more than mere decoration. The reader learns how
    to apply transitions and shared elements to efficiently use the minimal screen
    space of mobile devices and simplify application use and operation.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Behavioral Patterns"), *Behavioral Patterns*,
    concentrates on the major behavioral patterns, template, strategy, visitor and
    state. It provides working demonstrations of each and covers their flexibility
    and usage.'

- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Wearable Patterns"), *Wearable Patterns*,
    shows working of Android Wear, TV and Auto, demonstrating how to set up and configure
    each in turn. We examine the differences between these and the standard handheld
    app.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Social Patterns"), *Social Patterns*, shows
    how to add web functionality and social media. Firstly the WebView is explored
    and how it can be used to create internal web-apps. Next, how to connect our app
    to Facebook is explored, showing how this is done and what we can do with it.
    The chapter concludes by examining other social platforms, such as Twitter.'

    Patterns*, covers deployment, publication and monetization of Android apps. The
    reader is led through the registration and publication process and we take a look
    at advertising options and which are best suited to which purpose. Finally we
    look at how we can maximize potential users with a few tips and tricks of deployment.'
