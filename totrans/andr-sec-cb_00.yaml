- en: Android has quickly become one of the most popular mobile operating systems,
    not only to users but also developers companies of all kinds. Of course, because
    of this it's also become quite a popular platform to malicious adversaries.

- en: Android has been around in the public domain since 2005 and has seen massive
    growth in capability and complexity. Mobile smart phones in general now harbor
    very sensitive information about their users as well as access to their e-mails,
    text messages, and social and professional networking services. As with any software,
    this rise in capability and complexity also brings about a rise in security risk;
    the more powerful and more complex the software becomes, the harder they are to
    manage and adapt to the big bad world.

- en: This applies especially to software on mobile smart phones. These hot beds of
    personal and sensitive information present an interesting security context in
    which solve problems. From one perspective, the mobile smart phone security context
    is very difficult to compare to the servers on a network or in the "cloud" because,
    by their vry nature, they are not mobile. They cannot be moved or stolen very
    easily; we can enforce both software and physical security measures to protect
    unauthorized access to them. We can also monitor them constantly and rapidly respond
    to the security incidents autonomously. For the devices we carry around in our
    pockets and handbags, and forget in taxi cabs, the playing field is quite different!

- en: Android users and developers express a need to be constantly aware of their
    mobile security risks and, because of this need, mobile security and risk assessment
    specialists and security engineers are in high demand. This book aims to smoothen
    the learning curve for budding Android security assessment specialists and acts
    as a tool for experienced Android security professionals with which to hack away
    at common Android security problems.

    *Android Development Tools,* introduces us to setting up and running the tools
    developers use to cook up Android applications and native-level components on
    the Android platform. This chapter also serves as an introduction to those who
    are new to Android and would like to know what goes into setting up the common
    development environments and tools.'

    Security"), *Engaging with Application Security*, introduces us to the components
    offered by the Android operating system, dedicated to protecting the applications.
    This chapter covers the manual inspection and usage of some of the security-relevant
    tools and services used to protect applications and their interaction with the
    operating system.'

    well as new and upcoming security tools and frameworks used by Android security
    specialists to gauge the technical risks that applications expose their users
    to. Here you will learn to set up, run, and extend the hacking and reverse engineering
    tools that will be used in later chapters.'

    *Exploiting Applications*, covers the casing exploitation techniques that target
    the Android applications. The content in this chapter spans all the Android application
    component types and details how to examine them for security risks, both from
    a source code and inter-application context. It also introduces more advanced
    usage of the tools introduced in [Chapter 3](part0032_split_000.html#page "Chapter 3. Android

    *Protecting Applications*, is designed to be the complete opposite of [Chapter
    4](part0045_split_000.html#page "Chapter 4. Exploiting Applications"), Exploiting
    Applications. Instead of talking purely about application flaws, this chapter
    talks about application fixes. It walks readers through the useful techniques
    that developers can use to protect the applications from some of the attacks,
    which are detailed in [Chapter 4](part0045_split_000.html#page "Chapter 4. Exploiting
    Applications"), Exploiting Applications.'

    *Reverse Engineering Applications*, helps the readers to learn to crack open the
    applications and teaches them the techniques that Android reverse engineers use
    to examine and analyze applications. You learn about the Dex file format in great
    detail, as well as how to interpret Dex bytecode into useful representations that
    make reverse engineering easier. The chapter also covers the novel methods that
    reverse engineers can use to dynamically analyze applications and native components
    while they are running on an Android operating system.'

    Networking*, helps the readers to delve into the practical methods that application
    developers can follow to protect data while in transit across the network. With
    these techniques, you will be able to add stronger validation to the Secure Sockets
    Layer (SSL) communications.'

    Analysis"), *Native Exploitation and Analysis*, is dedicated to covering the security
    assessment and testing techniques focused on the native context of the Android
    platform. Readers will learn to look for security flaws that can be used to root
    phones and escalate privileges on the Android systems as well as perform low-level
    attacks against native services, including memory corruption and race condition
    exploitation.'

    Device Administration Policies"), *Encryption and Developing Device Administration
    Policies*, is focused heavily on how to use encryption correctly and avoid some
    of the common anti-patterns to keep data within your application secure. It recommends
    several robust and timesaving third-party libraries to quickly yet securely enhance
    the security of your applications. To wrap up, we will cover how to use the Android
    Device Administration API to implement and enforce enterprise security policies.'
