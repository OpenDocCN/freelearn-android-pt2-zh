- en: Now that you have completed the development of your cross-platform application,
    the next obvious step is to distribute your app on Google Play and iOS App Store.
    Xamarin apps are distributed in exactly the same way as Java or Objective-C apps;
    however, it can be a bit of a pain to get your app through the process. iOS has
    an official approval system, which makes app store submission a lengthier process
    than Android. Developers might have to wait for a week or longer, depending on
    how many times the app is rejected. Android requires some additional steps to
    submit the app on Google Play compared to debugging your application, but you
    can still get your application submitted in just a few hours.

    without facing App Store rejections. As long as you are not intentionally trying
    to break the rules, most applications will not face difficulty in getting approved.
    The most common rejections are related to mistakes by developers, which is a good
    thing, since you would not want to release an app with a critical issue to the

    Apple's review team will explicitly reference the guidelines if a rule is broken,

    issue without submitting a new build, you can respond to the app review team using
    the **Resolution Center** option in the iTunes Connect website. If you upload
    a new build, this will put your application at the end of the queue to be reviewed.

    if you are unsure about a specific guideline, it is best to seek professional,
    legal advice on the matter. Calling Apple's support number will not shed any light
    on the subject, since its support personnel are not allowed to give advice related

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From my personal experience, I have been submitting applications built with
    Xamarin to the iOS App Store and Google Play for quite some time. After delivering
    nearly 50 mobile applications totaling millions of downloads, a lot of lessons
    are learned about what makes a mobile application successful or a failure. Xamarin
    apps are indistinguishable from Java or Objective-C apps to the end user, so you
    can make your app successful by following the same patterns as standard iOS or
    Android applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There is quite a bit you can do to make your app more successful. Here are
    some tips to follow:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Pricing it right**: If your application appeals to everyone and everywhere,
    consider a *freemium* model that makes revenue from ad placements or IAPs. However,
    if your app is fairly niche, you will be much better off pricing your app at $4.99
    or higher. Premium apps must hold a higher standard of quality, but can earn decent
    revenue on a smaller number of users.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Knowing your competition**: If there are other apps in the same space as
    yours, make sure your application is better or offers a much wider feature set
    than the competition. It might also be a good idea to avoid the space altogether
    if there are already several apps competing with yours.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Prompting loyal users for reviews**: It is a good idea to prompt users for
    a review after they open your application several times. This gives users who
    actively use your application a chance to write a good review.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Supporting your users**: Provide a valid support e-mail address or Facebook
    page for you to easily interact with your users. Respond to bug reports and negative
    reviews. Google Play even has the option to e-mail users who write reviews on
    your app.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Keeping your application small**: Staying under the 100MB limit on iOS or
    50MB on Google Play will allow users to download your application on their cellular
    data plan. Doing this reduces the friction to install your app, as users will
    associate a lengthy download with a slow-running application.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Submitting your app to review websites**: Try to get as many reviews on the
    web as possible. Apple provides the ability to send coupon codes, but with the
    Android version of your app, you could send your actual Android package. Sending
    your app to review websites or popular YouTube channels can be a great way to
    gain free advertising.'

    and crash reports can be very helpful to understand your users. Fixing crashes
    in the wild and modifying your user interface to improve spending behavior is

    competitors.

    to the iOS App Store and Google Play. We covered the App Store Review Guidelines,
    and simplified them for the most common situations you might run into during the
    approval process. We went over the setup process for provisioning your app's metadata
    and uploading your binary to iTunes Connect. For Android, we went over how to
    create a production-signing key and sign your Android Package (APK) file. We went
    over submitting an application to Google Play, and finished the chapter with tips
    on delivering a successful, and hopefully profitable, application to the app stores.

    enable you to be very productive in comparison to the other options for mobile
    development. Additionally, you will save time by sharing code, without in any
    way limiting the native experience for your users.
