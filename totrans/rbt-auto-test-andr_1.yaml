- en: Automated testing helps us to maintain high software quality and provides a
    facility to capture if any code changes affect the actual use case. This chapter
    introduces the Robotium framework, its different features, and its benefits in
    the world of automated testing. By the end of this chapter, we will have a complete
    setup of the Android Environment in Eclipse IDE to get started with Robotium.

- en: Robotium is an open source automation testing framework that is used to write
    a robust and powerful black box for Android applications (the emphasis is mostly
    on black box test cases). It fully supports testing for native and hybrid applications.
    Native apps are live on the device, that is, designed for a specific platform
    and can be installed from the Google Play Store, whereas Hybrid apps are partly
    native and partly web apps. These can also be installed from the app store, but
    require the HTML to be rendered in the browser.

- en: Robotium is released under the Apache License 2.0\. It is free to download and
    can be easily used by individuals and enterprises and is built on Java and JUnit
    3\. It will be more appropriate to call Robotium an extension of the Android Test
    Unit Framework, available at [http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html).
    Robotium can also work without the application, under the test's source code.

    during installation in the following section—or on a real Android device. Developers
    can write function, system, and acceptance test scenarios across multiple activities.
