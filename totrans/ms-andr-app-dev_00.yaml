- en: This book is a practical guide to learning the development of advanced Android
    apps. This book helps master the core concepts of Android and quickly apply the
    knowledge in real-life projects. Throughout the book, an app is created, evolved
    in every chapter, so that the reader can easily follow and absorb the concepts.

- en: The book is divided into twelve chapters. The first three chapters are focused
    on the design of the app, explaining the basic concepts of design and the programming
    patterns used in Android. The next few chapters aim to improve the application,
    accessing the server side to download the information to be shown in the app.
    Once the app is functionally complete, it is improved using Material Design components
    and other third-party libraries.

    analytics, crash reports, and monetization. Finally, the app is exported, explaining
    the different build types and certificates, and uploaded to Play Store, ready
    to be distributed.

    the basics of Android 6 Marshmallow and important concepts of Material Design.
    We will set up the tools needed to start developing and, optionally, we will install
    an ultrafast emulator that is quicker than the Android default one, which will
    help us test our app along the book.'

    introduces the first step of creating an app—designing the navigation— and the
    different navigation patterns. We will apply the Tabs pattern with sliding screens,
    explaining and using Fragments, which is a key component in the Android app development.'

    an external server or API. We will create our own server using Parse, and we will

    information and converting it into usable objects using Gson.'
