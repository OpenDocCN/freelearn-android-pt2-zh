- en: This book is a practical guide to learning the development of advanced Android
    apps. This book helps master the core concepts of Android and quickly apply the
    knowledge in real-life projects. Throughout the book, an app is created, evolved
    in every chapter, so that the reader can easily follow and absorb the concepts.

- en: The book is divided into twelve chapters. The first three chapters are focused
    on the design of the app, explaining the basic concepts of design and the programming
    patterns used in Android. The next few chapters aim to improve the application,
    accessing the server side to download the information to be shown in the app.
    Once the app is functionally complete, it is improved using Material Design components
    and other third-party libraries.

- en: Before finishing, extra services are added to the app, such as location services,
    analytics, crash reports, and monetization. Finally, the app is exported, explaining
    the different build types and certificates, and uploaded to Play Store, ready
    to be distributed.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started"), *Getting Started*, explains
    the basics of Android 6 Marshmallow and important concepts of Material Design.
    We will set up the tools needed to start developing and, optionally, we will install
    an ultrafast emulator that is quicker than the Android default one, which will
    help us test our app along the book.'

    introduces the first step of creating an app—designing the navigation— and the
    different navigation patterns. We will apply the Tabs pattern with sliding screens,
    explaining and using Fragments, which is a key component in the Android app development.'

    *Creating and Accessing Content from the Cloud*, covers all that is necessary
    to display information from the Internet in our app. This information can be on
    an external server or API. We will create our own server using Parse, and we will
    access it with advanced network requests using Volley and OKHttp, processing the
    information and converting it into usable objects using Gson.'

    *Concurrency and Software Design Patterns*, talks about concurrency in Android
    and the different mechanisms to handle it, such as AsyncTask, Services, Loaders,
    and more. The second part of this chapter talks about the most common programming
    patterns used in Android.'

    lists and grids, starting with ListViews. It explains how this component evolved
    in RecyclerView, and as an example, it shows how to create a list with different
    types of elements on it.'

    and Material Design*, focuses on improving the app from a user interface perspective
    and introduces Material Design, explaining and implementing features such as CardView,
    Toolbar, and CoordinatorLayout.'

    Handling and Memory Management*, mostly talks about displaying images in our app
    that are downloaded from the Internet using different mechanisms such as Volley
    or Picasso. It also covers different types of images, such as Vector Drawable
    and Nine patch. Finally, it talks about memory management and preventing, detecting,
    and locating memory leaks.'

    which is critical to understand how users behave with our app, to capture error
    reports, and to keep our app free of bugs.'
