    Android application. It can be a static chart, which isn't that fun as it can
    be replaced simply by an image, or it can be a dynamic chart, allowing user interactions
    and reactions to data changes. This last case is where we can use a custom view
    to draw real-time graphs, add multiple sources of data, and even animate it. Let's
    start by building a very simple custom view where we'll add more features later

    be the right padding if our device is configured in **Right-To-Left** (**RTL**)
    mode. We have to be careful with these details if we'd like to support both LTR
    and RTL devices. In this specific example, we'll build it with RTL support by

- en: We also implemented a scroll correction mechanism to keep where we're zooming
    as centered as possible. In this case, we had to implement it on both the horizontal
    and the vertical axis. The main idea behind the algorithm is to calculate the
    horizontal and vertical position of the focused point of the gesture and when
    changing the zoom, adjusting the scroll position to keep it at the same place.

    then let's behave properly and save our `canvas` state, apply a translation by
    the scrolling values `frScrollX` and `frScrollY`, and scale the whole `canvas`
    by the `scale` variable.

    by the value of the scale variable. Before finishing the method, we''ve to restore
    our `canvas` and trigger a new redraw cycle if not all the property animations
    have finished:'

- en: In this chapter we have seen how to build a charts custom view to draw graphs
    in our Android applications. We have also quickly covered how to manage paddings,
    RTL / LTR support, and we have finally added some complexity to our custom view
    by supporting multiple data sets or adding the features of zooming and scrolling.

- en: Also, the way we've implemented this custom view; using independent data ranges
    and adapting it dynamically to the screen, means it'll automatically adjust to
    any screen resolution or for example, to an orientation change. This is usually
    a good practice and will prevent many issues when testing our custom view on several
    devices. In addition, making the sizes of everything we draw on the screen depend
    on the screen density, like we did in our previous example, will make the portability
    even easier.
