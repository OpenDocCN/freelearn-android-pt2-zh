- en: If you are reading this book, you probably already have a deep love for C#,
    .NET, and tools like Microsoft Visual Studio. Mobile development with the native
    SDKs seems daunting when you think about the work of learning a new platform,
    a new IDE, new application models, and perhaps a programming language or two.
    Xamarin aims to delight .NET developers with the tools for developing native iOS,
    Android, and Mac applications in C#.

  zh: 如果你正在阅读这本书，你可能已经深深爱上了C#、.NET和像Microsoft Visual Studio这样的工具。当你考虑到学习新平台、新IDE、新的应用程序模型，或许还有一两种编程语言的困难时，使用本地SDK的移动开发似乎令人畏惧。Xamarin旨在用C#为.NET开发者提供开发本地iOS、Android和Mac应用程序的工具。
- en: There are many advantages of choosing Xamarin to develop mobile applications
    instead of Java on Android and Objective-C/Swift on iOS. You can share code between
    both of these platforms and you can be more productive by taking advantage of
    the advanced language features of C# and the .NET base class libraries. Alternatively,
    you would have to write an entire application, twice, for both Android and iOS.

  zh: 选择Xamarin而不是在Android上使用Java，在iOS上使用Objective-C/Swift开发移动应用程序有很多优势。你可以在这两个平台之间共享代码，并且可以利用C#和.NET基类库的高级语言功能来提高生产效率。否则，你将不得不为Android和iOS分别编写整个应用程序。
- en: In comparison with other techniques for developing cross-platform applications
    with JavaScript and HTML, Xamarin has some distinct advantages. C# is generally
    more performant than JavaScript, and Xamarin gives developers direct access to
    the native APIs on each platform. This allows Xamarin applications to have a native
    look and perform in a manner similar to their Java or Objective-C counterparts.
    Xamarin's tooling works by compiling your C# into a native ARM executable that
    can be packaged as an iOS or Android application. It bundles a stripped-down version
    of the Mono runtime with your application that only includes the features of the
    base class libraries your app uses.

  zh: 与其他使用JavaScript和HTML开发跨平台应用程序的技术相比，Xamarin具有一些独特的优势。C#通常比JavaScript性能更好，Xamarin让开发者可以直接访问每个平台的本地API。这使得Xamarin应用程序能够拥有类似于Java或Objective-C对应程序的本地外观和性能。Xamarin的工具通过将C#编译成本地ARM可执行文件，该文件可以作为iOS或Android应用程序进行打包。它将一个精简版的Mono运行时与你的应用程序捆绑在一起，只包括你的应用程序使用的基类库功能。

- en: '**Mono**, an open source implementation of C# and the .NET framework, was originally
    developed by Novell to be used on Linux operating systems. Since iOS and Android
    are similarly based on Linux, Novell was able to develop MonoTouch and Mono for
    Android as products to target the new mobile platforms. Shortly after their release,
    a larger company acquired Novell, and the Mono team left to form a new company
    aimed primarily at mobile development. Xamarin was founded to focus on these tools
    for developing with C# on iOS and Android.'

    requires a few changes in your device settings. A Google Play developer account
    has only a one-time fee of $25 and doesn't have to be renewed each year. However,
    just like iOS, you will need a Google Play account to develop in-app purchases,
    push notifications, or Google Play Game Services. I would recommend setting up
    an account ahead of time if you inevitably plan on submitting an app to Google
    Play or need to implement one of these features.

    and iOS applications in C# whether you are using Mac OS X or a Windows PC. We
    installed Xcode and then ran the Xamarin all-in-one installer, which installs
    Java, the Android SDK, Xamarin Studio, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android. On Windows,
    we set up Xamarin for use inside Visual Studio and connected a Mac on our local
    network for iOS development. We set up the x86 Android emulator for a faster,
    more fluid experience when debugging applications. Finally, we set up iOS and
    Google Play developer accounts for distributing our applications.

    SDK、Xamarin Studio、Xamarin.iOS和Xamarin.Android。在Windows上，我们在Visual Studio内设置了Xamarin，并在本地网络上连接了一台Mac用于iOS开发。我们为调试应用程序时获得更快、更流畅的体验而设置了x86
    Android模拟器。最后，我们设置了iOS和Google Play开发者账户，以便分发我们的应用程序。
