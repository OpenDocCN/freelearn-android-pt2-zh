- en: During the course of this book you have learned how to use the Google Speech
    APIs and to apply a range of techniques as shown in the apps described in [Chapter
    8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Dialogs with Virtual Personal Assistants"), *Dialogs
    with Virtual Personal Assistants*. However, to keep these apps reasonably simple,
    some of the more advanced techniques were not utilized. This chapter suggests
    ways in which these techniques can be included in a more advanced virtual personal
    assistant.

    Personal Assistants*, in which simple pattern matching of the user's input with
    the pattern in an AIML category was used and the app's response was retrieved
    from the template of that category. Oob tags were used to pick up keywords such
    as search or URL in order to activate actions such as searching or launching a
    web page. A more advanced approach to the analysis of the user's input would involve
    filtering it using the techniques described in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Grammars
    for Dialog"), *Grammars for Dialog*, by developing grammars to parse the response
    returned by the speech recognition engine and classifying it into different types.

    and a traditional graphical user interface. Many commercial sites use talking-head
    technology (or avatars) to provide a persona for their VPA. A worthwhile enhancement
    would be to build a VPA that includes a talking head and also includes personal
    information to give the VPA a persona. There are several options available, some
    of which are referenced on the Pandorabots site ([http://www.pandorabots.com/](http://www.pandorabots.com/)).
