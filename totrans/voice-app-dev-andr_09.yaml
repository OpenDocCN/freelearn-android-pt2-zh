    APIs and to apply a range of techniques as shown in the apps described in [Chapter
    8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Dialogs with Virtual Personal Assistants"), *Dialogs
    with Virtual Personal Assistants*. However, to keep these apps reasonably simple,
    some of the more advanced techniques were not utilized. This chapter suggests
    ways in which these techniques can be included in a more advanced virtual personal
    assistant.

    "Chapter 8. Dialogs with Virtual Personal Assistants"), *Dialogs with Virtual
    Personal Assistants*, in which simple pattern matching of the user's input with
    the pattern in an AIML category was used and the app's response was retrieved
    from the template of that category. Oob tags were used to pick up keywords such
    as search or URL in order to activate actions such as searching or launching a
    web page. A more advanced approach to the analysis of the user's input would involve
    filtering it using the techniques described in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Grammars
    for Dialog"), *Grammars for Dialog*, by developing grammars to parse the response
    returned by the speech recognition engine and classifying it into different types.

- en: Currently the **user interface** is a combination of speech input and output
    and a traditional graphical user interface. Many commercial sites use talking-head
    technology (or avatars) to provide a persona for their VPA. A worthwhile enhancement
    would be to build a VPA that includes a talking head and also includes personal
    information to give the VPA a persona. There are several options available, some
    of which are referenced on the Pandorabots site ([http://www.pandorabots.com/](http://www.pandorabots.com/)).

    in this book. You are encouraged to test, modify, and play with the code provided
    in the book. In the website for the book at [http://lsi.ugr.es/zoraida/androidspeechbook](http://lsi.ugr.es/zoraida/androidspeechbook)
    you will find the source for the code, as well as further ideas for new projects,
    and a variety of interesting resources and updates. Voice technology is an exciting
    topic that offers an ocean of possibilities to Android developers. We invite you
    to take a deep breath and immerse yourself in it!
