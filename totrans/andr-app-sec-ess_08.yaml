    bringing their devices to work, and are demanding that corporate data be accessible
    on their personal or enterprise mobile device. This is a great convenience but

    are used repeatedly. We will use them throughout the remainder of the chapter
    as well, so let us understand what each of them means.

    the recent trend of employees bringing their own mobile devices to work, and accessing
    corporate data and application on their personal devices. An example is accessing
    e-mail and office documents on personal mobile devices.

    MDM refers to remote management of company owned or employee owned mobile devices
    that access enterprise applications and data. Features such as remotely wiping
    corporate data and asking a user to set a password are examples of MDM. These
    features enforce enterprise control over the system features.

- en: The third term that is used frequently in this context is **Mobile Application
    Management** (**MAM**). This term refers to the management of software and services
    on mobile devices that access the enterprise data. The examples of MAM include
    application upgrade, capturing crash logs and user statistics and sending it to
    the IT department. MAM is different from MDM as the latter focuses on device features,
    whereas MAM is focused on software and services installed on the device.

    can start with a pilot roll-out and then expand it slowly. This helps in two ways.
    First, IT can determine if their support infrastructure can scale with the increased
    number of users. Second, they can adjust their support based on the usage statistics
    gathered. Any errors and missing requirements can be fixed as the support expands
    to more employees.

    roll-out will help employees understand what is happening. This also helps them
    understand the rationale behind why some devices are allowed and others are not,
    what to expect, and safe practices to access corporate data on devices.

    independent regulator for all security firms doing business in the United States.
    FINRA''s mission is to protect America''s investors, by making sure the security
    industry operates fairly and honestly. They have issued guidelines regarding the
    supervision of electronic communication from mobile devices at its member firms.
    These need to be considered in conjunction with a firm''s own analysis. Check
    out FINRA''s website for more information: [www.finra.org](http://www.finra.org).
    There are three notices that FINRA has issued to expand upon the increasing proliferation
    of personal mobile devices and social websites. In all cases, it suggests that
    proper training should be given to all employees for it, maintaining records,
    judicious about posting on social media websites, and continuous supervision.'

    This notice provides the core guidelines on supervision of electronic communication
    via mobile devices. It suggests that corporate e-mail should always flow through
    corporate e-mail systems and should not be forwarded through personal accounts.
    These corporate e-mails should only flow through monitored networks. This will
    enable proper supervision of e-mails.

    This notice suggests that employees should not use business accounts on social
    media networks. These sites should be screened continuously for employee representation,
    as misleading information can adversely affect investors.

    This notice states that employees can use personal devices for communication as
    long as this information is retrievable and separate from personal communication.
    Ongoing supervision of devices is critical, as is ongoing training.

    along with many other device manufacturers promised to update devices within 18
    months of any new release of Android. This alliance was called the Android Update
    Alliance. The idea was noble and very much appreciated, but it has been hard for
    the OEMs to keep up with it.

- en: In this chapter, we focused on the management of company and employee owned
    devices that access the enterprise data. The issue for BYOD is that of trust,
    compliance, governance, and privacy, as more and more employees demand access
    of corporate data on their mobile devices. It is a delicate balance between user
    experience and security. We started off with the challenging Android ecosystem,
    followed by implementation details of device administration and a discussion of
    other enterprise capabilities provided by the Android stack. We closed the chapter
    on the next steps that should be considered to start supporting Android in the
    enterprise space with a discussion around compliance and policy.
