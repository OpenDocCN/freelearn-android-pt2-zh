    bringing their devices to work, and are demanding that corporate data be accessible
    on their personal or enterprise mobile device. This is a great convenience but
    is also a challenge of increasing magnitude. The cost of corporate data loss due
    to a compromised or lost device is huge.

    of mobile devices in the workforce. The first challenge is the wide array of mobile
    devices with different form factors and capabilities. The second challenge is
    to get employees on board and accept enterprise control on specific applications
    and parts of their device. The third challenge is the ongoing support of device
    administration.

    with a proposal for the next steps for setting up device administration on Android

    the recent trend of employees bringing their own mobile devices to work, and accessing
    corporate data and application on their personal devices. An example is accessing
    e-mail and office documents on personal mobile devices.

    MDM refers to remote management of company owned or employee owned mobile devices
    that access enterprise applications and data. Features such as remotely wiping
    corporate data and asking a user to set a password are examples of MDM. These
    features enforce enterprise control over the system features.

    Management** (**MAM**). This term refers to the management of software and services
    on mobile devices that access the enterprise data. The examples of MAM include
    application upgrade, capturing crash logs and user statistics and sending it to
    the IT department. MAM is different from MDM as the latter focuses on device features,
    whereas MAM is focused on software and services installed on the device.

    upcoming changes in the Android ecosystem. To keep your knowledge current, keen
    understanding of how users are interacting with their devices and upcoming innovation
    in this space is required. This Android expert should be an authority and the
    main point of contact for an enterprise application deployment on the Android
    devices.

- en: The second important step in this roll-out is to understand the preferences,
    requirements, and needs of your employee base. This step is important to make
    an informed decision about what applications and services are required by your
    employees and the kind of access control and policy that needs to be created.
    Gathering information about their device preference (whether they like phones
    or tablets), the applications they are comfortable with, the amount of access
    they require on their devices is important. Another factor is the geographical
    diversity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Different locations have different
    preferred devices, their own preferred applications, and their own level of interaction
    with the corporate data on a device.

  zh: 在此部署中的第二步是了解你的员工队伍的偏好、需求和需要。这一步很重要，以便做出关于你的员工需要哪些应用程序和服务的明智决定，以及需要创建何种访问控制和政策。收集有关他们的设备偏好（他们喜欢手机还是平板电脑）、他们习惯的应用程序、他们在设备上需要的访问量等信息是重要的。另一个因素是地理多样性。没有一种解决方案适合所有情况。不同的地点有不同的首选设备，他们自己的首选应用程序，以及与设备上的企业数据的互动程度。

    help with dealing the fragmentation issue on Android. These boundaries should
    be based on capabilities and not on versions or releases, since manufacturers
    and carriers port the same version differently on different devices.

- en: Another boundary to define is that of trust. A company's **Information Technology**
    (**IT**) department should allow increased access based on an increasing level
    of device capability. For example, if a device does not support full disk encryption,
    they can only read data and cannot store it on the device. Owing to Android's
    open app ecosystem, regular monitoring of application that users install on their
    device is important as well.

    Android applications can be installed from different sources and these sources
    do not curate the applications for security purposes as closely as the Apple App
    Store. Defining a boundary for which applications are allowed and which ones are
    not will go a long way in keeping the device secure.

    devices that access the enterprise data. The issue for BYOD is that of trust,
    compliance, governance, and privacy, as more and more employees demand access
    of corporate data on their mobile devices. It is a delicate balance between user
    experience and security. We started off with the challenging Android ecosystem,
    followed by implementation details of device administration and a discussion of
    other enterprise capabilities provided by the Android stack. We closed the chapter
    on the next steps that should be considered to start supporting Android in the
    enterprise space with a discussion around compliance and policy.
