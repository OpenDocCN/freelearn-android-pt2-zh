- en: Android 6 will primarily focus on improving the overall user experience, and
    it will bring in a few features, such as a redesigned permission model in which
    applications are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions
    at the time of installation, the Doze power scheme for extended battery life when
    a device is not manipulated by the user, and native support for fingerprint recognition.

    part of a development team at a company, an independent app developer, or just
    as a programmer using Android development best practices.

    "Chapter 1. Android Marshmallow Permissions"), *Android Marshmallow Permissions*,
    discusses how the Android permission system and model are vast and have made a
    few changes that can help app developers and applications gain more traction,
    installations, and give users the ability to decide when your applications will
    be able to use each permission-dependent feature. Keep in mind, though, that this
    is just a starting point and Android Marshmallow still needs to gain market share
    and get adopted by OEMs, enabling users with the freedom of choice. You as an
    app developer must prepare in advance and make sure your application development
    is forward-facing, allowing new users to enjoy the latest updates as soon as possible
    while maintaining a high level of performance for your applications.'

    "Chapter 2. App Links"), *App Links*, talks about how app linking has become powerful
    in Android Marshmallow. This allows you, the app developers, help the system better
    decide how to act. Handling web URLs will give you wider exposure, a bigger funnel
    into your apps, and better experience, which you can provide to your users (sums
    up to better ratings and more downloads and vice versa).'

- en: App linking is simple to implement, easy to understand, and is a must-have feature
    in the mobile/web world today. While app linking enables better action handling
    for users using your applications, users can have multiple devices, expecting
    the same behavior on each device, and would be more engaged if their data and
    action handling is all around.

    Marshmallow brings with it a great backup feature for apps, reducing friction
    for users migrating to new devices.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a world full of such diverse apps, maximizing the benefits from automatic
    backups leads to excellent user experience. The goal of this feature is to unload
    the burden and shorten the time required to set up a new device with the user's
    favorite apps. Allowing the users to enter your app with just a password prompt,
    if required, after a new installation can be a great experience. Try it yourself!

    we need to always maintain a viable connection with the needs of an organization.
    Making sure that we go over and understand the Android for Work world with the

    and the look and feel. This helps us keep the user in our application and still

    gives us a new API to authenticate users with the fingerprint API. We can use
    the sensor and authenticate the user even within our application and save it for
    later usage if we want to save the need of user login using the Credentials grace
    period abilities Android Marshmallow has introduced. We also covered a way to
    make our application more secure using HTTPS only. The StrictMode policy, enforced
    with the help of the usesCleartextTraffic flag, allows us to make sure that all
    the nodes we connect to the outer world are examined to check if there''s a need
    for a secure connection or not.'
