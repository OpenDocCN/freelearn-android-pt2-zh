    2005\. The beta version of Android came back in November 2007 and the commercial
    version 1.0 was released in September 2008\. As of 2013, over 500 million active

    middleware and key applications (platform). The Android **Software Development
    Kit** (**SDK**) provides the tools and **Application Programming Interfaces**
    (**API**s) necessary to begin developing applications on the Android platform
