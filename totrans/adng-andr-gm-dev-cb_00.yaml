- en: AndEngine is an excellent, full-featured, free, and open source 2D framework
    for the Android platform. It is one of few 2D frameworks for the Android platform
    which is consistently being used to create stylish and fun games by both independent
    and professional developers alike, and has even been used in some of the most
    successful games on the market to date. However, it takes more than just using
    a specific framework to achieve success.

- en: '*AndEngine for Android Game Development Cookbook* provides many informative
    walkthroughs relating to the most important aspects of AndEngine at a general
    game-programming level. The book covers everything from the life cycle of an AndEngine
    game to placing sprites on the scene and moving them around, all the way through
    to creating destructible objects and raycasting techniques. Even more importantly,
    this book is entirely based on AndEngine''s latest and most efficient Anchor-Center
    branch.'

    Structure*, covers the important aspects of game development with AndEngine regarding
    the core components that most games need to survive. Everything from audio, textures,
    the AndEngine life cycle, saving/loading game data, and more, are covered in this
    chapter.'

    begins to familiarize us with AndEngine''s `Entity` class as well as its subtypes,
    such as sprites, text, primitives, and more. The `Entity` class is the core component
    of AndEngine that allows objects in code to be displayed onscreen. More specifically,
    this chapter includes a list of the most important methods included in the `Entity`
    class in order to allow us to take full control over how our entities act, react,
    or simply what they will look like.'

    introduces some of the more common aspects of menu design in mobile games. The
    topics covered in this chapter include creating buttons, adding theme music to
    the menu, creating parallax backgrounds, and menu screen navigation. The topics
    found within this chapter can easily be used in other areas of a game as well.'

    discusses the various options included in AndEngine when it comes to how the game
    camera and engine view the game''s scene. We begin by going over the different
    types of camera objects available to us in order to give us a proper understanding
    of the benefits of each for an informative decision. From there, we continue on
    to cover camera movement and zooming, creating extra large backgrounds, creating
    a heads-up-display, and even go as far as introducing the split screen game engine
    for more complex game design.'

    of AndEngine developers. Starting with the first few chapters, the reader will
    begin to work with the basics of AndEngine, and even intermediate developers will
    find useful tips throughout these chapters. As the reader progresses through the
    chapters, topics that are more difficult will be covered so it is important that
    beginners do not skip ahead. Additionally, intermediate developers who have not
    yet made the transition to AndEngine''s latest development branch will find useful
    information throughout the book on the differences between the GLES1/GLES2 branches
    versus the Anchor-Center branch discussed in this book.'
