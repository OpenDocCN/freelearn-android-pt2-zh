    of our own contentthis kind of device hasbeen on the market since 1992 (the first
    was the Simon model by IBM) the big diffusion was driven by Apple's produced 2007
    (this year has been released).

    used as internal operating system in mobile devicesdifferen from the leader of
    the market, this company doesn't constraint to a unique hardware-specific device
    but allows party compan to use it on cellphones different characteristics. The
    big advantage was also to be able to sell this device to consumers that don't
    want to (or can't have) spend much money as the Apple phone. This allowed Android
    to win the battle of diffusion.

- en: But there is another side to the coin. A variety of devices by different producers
    means more fragmentation of the underlying system and a non-uniform user experience
    that can be really disappointing. As programmers, we have to take into account
    these problems and this book strives to be a useful guideline to solve that problem.
