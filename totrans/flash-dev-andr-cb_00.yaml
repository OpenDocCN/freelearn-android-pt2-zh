- en: With the ongoing explosion of the mobile Android operating system and proliferation
    of Android powered devices in the smart phone and tablet computing markets, this
    is the perfect time to explore the world of Android development using the Flash
    Platform. Adobe recently released statistics announcing that by the end of 2011,
    it is projected that more than 200 million smartphones and tablets will support
    Adobe AIR applications. For 2011, the company expects the mobile Flash Player
    to be supported on more than 132 million units worldwide. This book provides a
    variety of fundamental recipes exploring common needs of the mobile Android developer
    when utilizing these Flash Platform runtimes.

- en: Many existing Flash application developers are excited with the prospect of
    building mobile applications for Android devices, but where to begin? Expand your
    reach into mobile application development by using this text as a guide. When
    possible, the recipes in this book are written using pure ActionScript 3, allowing
    the reader to work through each example in the tool of their choice. In some instances,
    we demonstrate the power and flexibility of the mobile Flex framework when dealing
    with specific layout and structural needs. Jump-start your experience with mobile
    Android through the step-by-step examples found within.

- en: To make use of the recipes included in this book, you need access to software
    for developing Android applications with the Flash Platform. We recommend using
    Adobe Flash Builder 4.5, Adobe Flash Professional CS5.5, or PowerFlasher FDT 4.2
    and above. These Integrated Development Environments are preferred because of
    their specific support of a mobile Android workflow, but you may actually use
    any application you prefer to write code that will be compiled for AIR for Android
    and deployed to mobile devices.
